<h1>Angular Typescript project generator</h1>
<h2>Make <code>Angular 1</code> feel like <code>Angular 2</code></h2>
<p>
    Angular-ts is a project starter that mimics the angular 2 syntax but lets you use the existing angular 1 plugins.
    It is already fully configured and uses <code>gulp</code> as a build manager. Angular-ts has its own generator that will create the
    project and make it easy to add additional elements to your angular application.
    Although this starter is very easy to understand and it is aimed to all categories of developers (starter-advanced) it is recommended
    that you gain some basic knowledge of Angular and Typescript before using this starter.
</p>

<p>If you want to contribute to <code>angular-ts</code> please fork angular-ts or the generator-angular-ts repositories
and submit pull requests.</p>
